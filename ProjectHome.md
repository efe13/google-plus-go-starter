# Google+ Go Starter Project #

These starter projects demonstrate use of the Google+ APIs and development best practices.

You can use these projects to experiment with the Google+ API without having to understand the details (e.g. OAuth2). You can also use them as a starting point for building your own Google+ applications.

They are available for these platforms:
  * Command line
  * Google App Engine ([demo](http://plus-api-go-starter.appspot.com/))
