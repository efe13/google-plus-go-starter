    <h1>Plus.Me</h1>
    <p>
      If you want to get the current user's public profile, you can write:
      <code>
        userProfile, err := p.People.Get("me").Do()
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The special value &quot;me&quot; is used instead of a profile ID and
      refers to the current user. Associating the current user with their
      profile by using the &quot;me&quot; value requires OAuth authorization
      from the user with the <em>plus.me</em> scope.
    </p>
