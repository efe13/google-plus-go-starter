    <h1>Activities.Get</h1>
    <p>
      Using the Google+ APIs, you can fetch public activities by specifying
      their IDs:
      <code>
        activity, err := p.Activities.Get("z12gtjhq3qn2xxl2o224exwiqruvtda0i").Do()
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The user doesn't have to authorize your application in order to fetch
      public activities. Your app simply specifies the activity ID and your API
      key. The source code for this application can show you how.
