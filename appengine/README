Running the Google+ Go Starter Project for App Engine (on Linux and Mac)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. You'll need to have Python (at http://python.org/) and Mercurial
  (at http://mercurial.selenic.com/) installed.

  You'll also need to have activated access to the Google+ APIs and updated the
  appengine/app/api/config.json file with your values from
  https://code.google.com/apis/console > "API Access". See the top-level README
  for more details.

1. Download and install the Google App Engine SDK for Go (at
  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Go).
  Don't forget to add the google_appengine/ directory to your $PATH.

2. In a Terminal, cd into the appengine/ directory (the directory where this
  README file lives):

    > cd appengine/

3. This project depends on the goauth2 (at http://code.google.com/p/goauth2/)
  and google-api-go-client (at http://code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client/)
  Go libraries. To use them on Google App Engine, download them to the
  appengine/ directory:

    (From the appengine/ directory)
    > mkdir goauth2.googlecode.com
    > hg clone https://code.google.com/p/goauth2 goauth2.googlecode.com/hg
    > mkdir google-api-go-client.googlecode.com
    > hg clone https://code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client google-api-go-client.googlecode.com/hg

4a. This project also depends on the
  google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg/noauth package. If you cloned the
  entire Google Code repository (at
  https://code.google.com/p/google-plus-go-starter/), the noauth package is
  included. You can simply symlink to it:

    (From the appengine/ directory)
    > mkdir -p google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg
    > ln -s ../../../noauth google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg/noauth

4b. Otherwise, if you do not have the noauth package locally (e.g. if you only
  cloned the appengine/ directory from the Google Code repository), you can
  just download the noauth package to the appengine/ directory:

    (From the appengine/ directory)
    > mkdir -p google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg
    > hg clone https://code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client/noauth google-api-go-client.googlecode.com/hg/noauth

5. Run the App Engine development server:

    (From the appengine/ directory)
    > dev_appserver.py .

6. Visit http://localhost:8080/ in a browser.
