Running the Google+ Go Starter Project for App Engine (on Linux and Mac)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. You'll need to have Python (at http://python.org/) and Mercurial
  (at http://mercurial.selenic.com/) installed.

  You'll also need to have activated access to the Google+ APIs and updated the
  appengine/app/api/config.json file with your values from
  https://code.google.com/apis/console > "API Access". See the top-level README
  for more details.

1. Download and install the Google App Engine SDK for Go (at
  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Go).
  Make sure to add the google_appengine/ directory to your $PATH. If you're
  using bash and the App Engine SDK is installed in the ~/google_appengine
  directory, you can add it to your $PATH by doing:

    > # You can also use ~/.bash_profile instead of ~/.bashrc for these commands.
    > echo '# Google App Engine SDK for Go Environment' >> ~/.bashrc
    > echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/google_appengine' >> ~/.bashrc
    > source ~/.bashrc

2. In a Terminal, cd into the appengine/ directory (the directory where this
  README file lives):

    > cd google-plus-go-starter/appengine/
    > ls
    app app.yaml README static templates

3. This project depends on the goauth2 (at http://code.google.com/p/goauth2/)
  and google-api-go-client (at http://code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client/)
  Go libraries. To use them on Google App Engine, download them to the
  appengine/ directory:

    > mkdir goauth2.googlecode.com
    > hg clone https://code.google.com/p/goauth2 goauth2.googlecode.com/hg
    > mkdir google-api-go-client.googlecode.com
    > hg clone https://code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client google-api-go-client.googlecode.com/hg

4. This project also depends on the noauth package in the parent directory. You
  can simply symlink to it:

    > mkdir -p google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg
    > # Symlink loops cause dev_appserver.py to go crash, so avoid them.
    > ln -s ../../../noauth google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg/noauth

5. Run the App Engine development server:

    > # You have to update the values in appengine/app/api/config.json before starting the development server.
    > # See the top-level README for more details.
    > dev_appserver.py .

6. Visit http://localhost:8080/ in a browser.
