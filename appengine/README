Running the Google+ Go Starter Project for App Engine (on Linux and Mac)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Python. You can follow the instructions at
  http://python.org/download/.

  Install Mercurial. You can follow the instructions at
  http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/.

  Install the Google App Engine SDK for Go. You can follow the instructions at
  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Go.

2. Add the Google App Engine SDK directory to your $PATH. It's usually named
  google_appengine/.

  If you're using bash and the Google App Engine SDK directory lives at
  ~/google_appengine/, you can add it to your $PATH by doing:

    > # You can also use ~/.bash_profile instead of ~/.bashrc for these commands.
    > echo '# Google App Engine SDK for Go Environment' >> ~/.bashrc
    > echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/google_appengine' >> ~/.bashrc
    > source ~/.bashrc

2. In a Terminal, cd into the google-plus-go-starter/appengine/ directory (the
  directory where this README file lives):

    > cd google-plus-go-starter/appengine/
    > ls
    app app.yaml README static templates

3. This project depends on the goauth2 (at http://code.google.com/p/goauth2/)
  and google-api-go-client (at http://code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client/)
  Go libraries. To use them on Google App Engine, download them to the
  google-plus-go-starter/appengine/ directory:

    > mkdir goauth2.googlecode.com
    > hg clone https://code.google.com/p/goauth2 goauth2.googlecode.com/hg
    > mkdir google-api-go-client.googlecode.com
    > hg clone https://code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client google-api-go-client.googlecode.com/hg

4. This project also depends on the noauth package in the parent directory. You
  can simply symlink to it:

    > mkdir -p google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg
    > # Symlink loops cause dev_appserver.py to go crash, so avoid them.
    > ln -s ../../../noauth google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg/noauth

5. Run the App Engine development server (you have to update the values in
  google-plus-go-starter/appengine/app/api/config.json before starting the
  development server. See the top-level README for more details):

    > dev_appserver.py .

6. Visit http://localhost:8080/ in a browser.
