Running the Google+ Go Starter Project for command-line (on Linux and Mac)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. You'll need to have activated access to the Google+ APIs and updated the
  cli/api/config.json file with your values from
  https://code.google.com/apis/console > "API Access". See the top-level README
  for more details.

1. Download and install Go (at http://golang.org/). Make sure to add $GOROOT/bin
  to your $PATH. If you're using bash and Go is installed in the ~/go directory,
  you can add it to your $PATH by doing:

    > # You can also use ~/.bash_profile instead of ~/.bashrc for these commands.
    > echo '# Go Environment' >> ~/.bashrc
    > echo 'export GOROOT=$HOME/go' >> ~/.bashrc
    > echo 'export GOBIN=$GOROOT/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
    > echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN' >> ~/.bashrc
    > source ~/.bashrc

2. In a Teminal, cd into the top-level directory (ABOVE the directory where this
  README file lives):

    > cd google-plus-go-starter/
    > ls
    appengine cli COPYING noauth README

3. Use goinstall (documentation at http://golang.org/cmd/goinstall) to build the
  executable:

    > # Have goinstall use this directory as a parallel Go source tree.
    > export GOPATH=`pwd`
    > # Make this directory look like a Go source tree.
    > mkdir -p src/google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com
    > ln -s ../.. src/google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg
    > # Build and "install" the executable into the bin/ directory.
    > goinstall google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg/cli
    > ls
    appengine bin cli COPYING goinstall.log noauth pkg README src

4. Run the executable:

    > # You might need to run `chmod u+x bin/cli` first.
    > bin/cli -help
    > # You have to update the values in cli/api/config.json before running the executable.
    > # See the top-level README for more details.
    > bin/cli -configPath=cli/api/config.json
