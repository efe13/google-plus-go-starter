Running the Google+ Go Starter Project for command-line (on Linux and Mac)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Go. You can follow the instructions at
  http://golang.org/doc/install.html#fetch.

2. Add your Go installation's bin/ directory to your $PATH.

  If you're using bash and Go is installed in your home directory at ~/go, you
  can add its bin/ directory to your $PATH by doing:

    > # You can also use ~/.bash_profile instead of ~/.bashrc for these commands.
    > echo '# Go Environment' >> ~/.bashrc
    > echo 'export GOROOT=$HOME/go' >> ~/.bashrc
    > echo 'export GOBIN=$GOROOT/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
    > echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN' >> ~/.bashrc
    > source ~/.bashrc

3. In a Teminal, cd into the google-plus-go-starter/ directory (ABOVE the
  directory where this README file lives):

    > cd google-plus-go-starter/
    > ls
    appengine cli COPYING noauth README

4. Use goinstall (documentation at http://golang.org/cmd/goinstall) to build the
  executable:

    > # Have goinstall use this directory as a parallel Go source tree.
    > export GOPATH=`pwd`
    > # Make this directory look like a Go source tree.
    > mkdir -p src/google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com
    > ln -s ../.. src/google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg
    > # Build and "install" the executable into the bin/ directory.
    > goinstall google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg/cli
    > ls
    appengine bin cli COPYING goinstall.log noauth pkg README src

5. Run the executable (you have to update the values in
  google-plus-go-starter/cli/api/config.json before running the executable. See
  the top-level README for more details):

    > # You might need to run `chmod u+x bin/cli` first.
    > bin/cli -help
    > bin/cli -configPath=cli/api/config.json
