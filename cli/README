Running the Google+ Go Starter Project for command-line (on Linux and Mac)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. You'll need to have activated access to the Google+ APIs and updated the
  cli/api/config.json file with your values from
  https://code.google.com/apis/console > "API Access". See the top-level README
  for more details.

1. Download and install Go (at http://golang.org/). Don't forget to add
  $GOROOT/bin to your $PATH.

2. In a Teminal, cd into the top-level directory (ABOVE the directory where this
  README file lives):

    > ls
    appengine cli COPYING noauth README

3. Use goinstall (http://golang.org/cmd/goinstall) to build the executable:

    > export GOPATH=`pwd`
    > mkdir -p src/google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com
    > ln -s ../.. src/google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg
    > goinstall google-plus-go-starter.googlecode.com/hg/cli

4. Run the executable (it lives in the newly created bin/ directory):

    > chmod u+x bin/cli
    > bin/cli --help
