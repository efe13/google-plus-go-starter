Google+ Go Starter Project
--------------------------

This project shows you how to create applications in Go that use the Google+
APIs.

You can use the provided subprojects (Go apps for Google App Engine and the
command-line) as a foundation for your own applications so you can experiment
right away, without worrying about how everything works in detail (e.g. OAuth2).


Getting Started
---------------

Register a new project and activate Google+ API access:
  - Visit https://code.google.com/apis/console/
  - If you don't already have a project, click "Create project..."
  - In the "Services" section, activate access to the "Google+ API"
  - In the "API Access" section (navigate to it from the left column), click
    "Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID..."
  - Enter a "Product name" and click "Next"
  - Depending on whether you want to run the Google App Engine app or
    command-line app, choose the "Application type" to be "Web application" or
    "Installed application". You can set up the other type of application
    later
    - If you want to run the App Engine app, choose the "Application type" to be
      "Web application". For "Your site or hostname", select "http://" as the
      protocol and put "localhost:8080" as the domain name
    - If you want to run the command-line app, choose the "Application type" to
      be "Installed application"
  - Click "Create client ID"
  - If you want to run the other kind of app as well, click on "Create another
    client ID"

Copy the API Access configuration values:
  - Visit https://code.google.com/apis/console/
  - Navigate to the "API Access" section (from the left column)
  - Copy the values for "Client ID", "Client secret" and "API key" to the
    correct "config.json" file(s):

      - If you want to run the App Engine app, copy the values for "Client ID"
        and "Client secret" in the "Client ID for web applications" box to the
        appropriate places in the appengine/app/api/config.json file. Copy the
        value for "API key" in the "Simple API Access" box to the appropriate
        place in the appengine/app/api/config.json file.

      - If you want to run the command-line app, copy the values for
        "Client ID" and "Client secret" in the "Client ID for installed
        applications" box to the appropriate places in the cli/api/config.json
        file. Copy the value for "API key" in the "Simple API Access" box to the
        appropriate place in the cli/api/config.json file.

Build and run the app:
  - For the App Engine app, follow the directions in appengine/README
  - For the command-line app, follow the directions in cli/README
